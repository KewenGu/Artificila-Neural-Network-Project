In this project, we implemented simulated an artificial neural network, and training the data using backpropagation algorithm.
How to run it (under the project directory):
        python ann.py h [number of hidden layers] p [holdout percentage]
Specify the hidden layers of the perceptron (ANN) using the h switch, and the holdout testing set percentage using the p switch.
